Bonus Deliverables
These bonus deliverables are optional and won’t affect your score but are great for additional learning!

As a user, I should be able to:

1. Sort products by name or price (ascending/descending).
2. Persist the cart state by saving it locally (e.g., localStorage).
3. Display a message when the cart is empty or no products are available.
4. Add search functionality to filter products by name.
